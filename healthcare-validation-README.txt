1. Statistical Validation:
   - Data quality metrics (completeness, consistency)
   - Pattern validation (emergency night patterns, department differences)
   - Utilization metrics validation
   - Statistical tests (normality, ANOVA, t-tests)

2. Visualizations:
   - Utilization patterns (hourly, departmental, heatmap)
   - Department comparisons (efficiency, staff utilization)
   - Temporal patterns (daily, weekly trends)
   - Resource distribution (usage by resource, density plots)

3. Validation Results:
   - Detailed reports on data quality
   - Statistical significance of patterns
   - Accuracy of metrics
   - Test results and p-values

The code saves four visualization files:
1. `utilization_patterns.png`: Shows usage patterns and distributions
2. `department_comparisons.png`: Compares department efficiency metrics
3. `temporal_patterns.png`: Shows time-based patterns
4. `resource_distribution.png`: Shows resource usage distribution
